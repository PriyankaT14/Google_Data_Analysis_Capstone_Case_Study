This Data Analysis Capstone project is an optional part of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Cousera. 

### Background: 

Bellabeat: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

### Task:

Sršen is confident that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data (i.e. FitBit Fitness Tracker Data) would reveal more opportunities for growth and has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### Business Objectives:

1.	What are some trends in smart device usage? 
2.	How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 
3.	How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
